## Project Description:
Our planet is suffering from global warming as a result of increasing carbon emissions. since the industrial revolution, the use of fossil fuels as a resource of energy has been increased. Fossil fuels are used as a resource of energy because when they are burned they give off a big amount of energy that is used in different industrial processes and many machines. moreover, fossil fuels are non-renewable resources of energy this means that they will run out one day. So, people change their direction to provide new resources of energy that can last and be alternative so they can reduce air pollution and global warming and its effects on the environment at first and provide new sources of energy to use for different processes instead of non-renewable ones as fossil fuels. our project is designed to solve these problems in the way of increasing the alternative resources so the dependent on nonrenewable and pollution causing resources will decrease .the project is using the solar energy and converting it to electrical energy by collecting the light with parabola-shaped mirrors and intending it on a face of copper-cuboidal container that contains sand as its high conserving and storing abilities of heat. The copper container is placed in contact with thermoelectric devices that use the difference of temperatures to produce electricity the greater the difference between temperatures the grater the electricity production. Another container is placed in contact with the other face of the thermoelectric device. this container is the cold side or the side that has less temperature. This container contains slats like potassium nitrate which are added to water to maintain the hexagonal shape of water and decreasing its freezing point. to reach the desired results we must have to put the project in areas that have a high intensity of solar energy.so we modified the project by robot send and receive data to the center that is responsible to watch all the devices in a given area. the robot will depend on the electrical energy that is produced by the device as a resource of energy. and if anything happened to the device it will stop sending signs and the experts will go and fix the problems.
